            <p> Over the past few decades, a lot of research and advancement has been going on how to increase the
                speed
                of
                processing of data and its storage.
                Scientists and engineers are working on a two-level quantum system which can take both the values

            <h2>History: -</h2>
            <p>The spark of quantum computing was brought by Richard Feynmann in 1981 when he discussed that
                Classical
                computers cannot simulate the vast quantum world. In 1994 Peter Shor developed the 1st quantum
                algorithm
                which could factorize large integers quicker than a classical computer can do. In 1998 1st 2 qubit
                quantum
                computer was developed which could solve quantum algorithms. In 2017 IBM presented 1st commercially
                usable
                quantum computer which can be simulated from anywhere.
                Recently Google and China have claimed to reach up to 56 qubits.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Quantum Computing: -</h2>
            <p>Quantum computing uses the weirdness of quantum mechanics to solve tedious calculations which cannot
                be
                done
                by simple classical computers.
                It works on a two-level system called Qubit. The input data is static but during the processing the
                data
                doesn’t remain static but exist in multistate before observation and each state has their
                probability of
                equal existence until the measurement where a single state remains.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Qubits vs Classical bit: -</h2>
            <p>A qubit is a two-level system also known as Quantum bit. It is the quantum analog of a classical bit
                i.e.
                (0, 1). It can take value |0>, |1> or linear combination of both states.
                A classical bit is a static bit whereas a quantum bit is a dynamic bit. Due to its this property, it
                is
                widely used in solving calculations of algorithms which classical bit will take millions of years to
                solve
                and it can solve in seconds.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Bloch Sphere And Hilbert Space: -</h2>
            <p>Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum
                mechanical
                system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch. It is a unit 2-sphere, with antipodal points
                corresponding to a pair of mutually orthogonal state vectors. The north and south poles of the Bloch
                sphere
                are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors |0> and |1>, respectively.
                A Hilbert space is a vector space equipped with an inner product, an operation that allows defining
                lengths
                and angles. Hilbert spaces are complete, which means that there are enough limits in the space to
                allow
                the
                techniques of calculus to be used.
                Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts like projection and change of
                basis
                from
                their usual finite dimensional setting.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Quantum Superposition: -</h2>
            <p>It is a feature of a quantum system due to which it can exist in more than one state at any instant.
                Just like a wave two or more quantum states superpose to form another quantum state.
                Ψ3= ψ1+ ψ2
                A quantum state is a linear combination of basis state represented in Bra-Ket system.
                Ψ=a|0> +b|1>
                Basis vectors |0> and |1> are orthogonal vectors and squares of coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ describes
                the
                probability of |o> and |1> states in a quantum state.
                a^2 + b^2 = 1
                In Schrodinger’s Cat Experiment the probabilities of Cat to be alive or dead are equal so the cat is
                in
                a
                superposition state of dead and alive.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Quantum Entanglement : -</h2>
            <p>It is a quantum weird phenomenon in which a group or pain of particles are generated whose quantum
                states
                are not independent and interact even when are at million miles apart in space. Any change in
                quantum
                state
                one of the particles bring the change in the other part of the pair.
                Measurement of properties like momentum, electron spin, position, polarization etc. resembles in the
                entangled duo.
                Researchers are working on technology that enables the transfer of qubits between any two points.
                Such
                quantum bits can be |0> and |1> at the same time, and are entangled.
                 Entanglement allows improved coordination between distant sites. This makes it extremely suitable
                for
                tasks such as clock synchronization.
                 Entanglement is inherently secure. Any two quantum bits with maximum entanglement, have no any
                share
                of
                rest environment in that entanglement. This makes entanglement uniquely suitable for applications
                that
                require security and privacy.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Quantum Measurement: -</h2>
            <p>In Quantum Physics or Computing Measurement is an important process in which the quantum state in the
                linear
                combination of basis states resolves into either of the basis states i.e., |0> or |1>.
                Before measurement a quantum particle can exist in millions of possible combinations of basis states
                but
                during measurement it gives the exact one possible outcome.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Quantum Algorithm and Gates: -</h2>
            <p>Quantum algorithms are set of rules which runs on a realistic model of quantum computing, using
                quantum
                circuits.
                Classical algorithms are finite sequence of instructions, or a step-by-step procedure for solving a
                problem,
                where each instruction can be performed on a classical computer. Likewise, a quantum algorithm is a
                step-by-step procedure, where each of the steps can be performed on a quantum computer.
                What makes quantum algorithms superior is that they are able to solve some problems faster than
                classical
                algorithms because of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement that allows them to be
                efficiently
                simulated on classical computers.
                Quantum logic gate is a basic quantum circuit which works on a small number of qubits. They are the
                building
                units of quantum circuits.
                Quantum gates are basically matrices(operators) which work on eigen vectors i.e., quantum states and
                gives a
                scalar value called eigen values. They are reversible unlike most classical logic gates.
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Some of the important logic gates are: -</h3>
            <li>Pauli -X gate: - It is a bit flip gate. |0> -X- |1> |1> -X- |0></li>
            <li>Pauli -Z gate: - It is a phase shift gate. |0> -Z- |0> |1> -Z- -|1></li>
            <li>Hadamard gate: - This gate creates the equal probabilities of 0 and 1.
                |0> -H- = (1/2)^2 |0> + (1/2)^2 |1> |1> -H- = (1/2)^2 |0> - (1/2)^2 |1></li>
            <li>CNOT gate: - This gate operates on two qubits in such a way that the first qubit serves as a control
                and
                other qubit serves as target.</li>
            <li>Swap gate: - It performs half-way of a two-qubit swap. Any many-qubit gate can be constructed from
                only
                swap
                and single qubit gates.</li>
            <br>
            <h2>Different Stages of Quantum Computing: -</h2>

            <p>Quantum Software and circuit (Quantum Algorithms)</p>
            <br>
            <p> Classical Software and circuits</p>

            <p>Quantum Hardware</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How A New Quantum World Will Look?</h2>
            <p>A quantum world with quantum computers working on a two-level system will change the way we work. We
                will
                be
                much faster in calculations and data processing; the data privacy and security will be at the next
                level
                making it almost impossible for hackers to access data of individuals. The quantum properties like
                entanglement and superposition alive the hopes of space travel and fast transfer of information.
                Other
                than
                data processing quantum bits would be capable of simulating molecular bonds performing rapid
                searches of
                complicated databases or factorizing large numbers very quickly. Quantum computing will modify every
                field
                from healthcare to security, weather forecast and disaster management. It can be understandable</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Where Do We Stand In Quantum Computing?</h2>
            <p>Different big companies like IBM, Google, Nasa are working in development of quantum computing
                technologies.
                IBM has its own quantum computing environment called Qiskit which can be simulated from any corner
                of
                the
                world by classical computers.
                In India Quantum Computing is yet to advance and only researches on quantum computing are going on.
                The
                Department of Science & Technology (DST) has set up QuEST or Quantum-Enabled Science & Technology
                (QuEST) at
                an institute in Hyderabad. As indicated in the Union Budget 2020, quantum technology is opening up
                new
                frontiers in computing, communications and cyber security with widespread applications. The aim is
                to
                boost
                research for commercial applications in quantum technologies. Skills in quantum computing need to be
                developed as objects become smarter and computers become faster.
                Under the leadership of a profound Scholar Researcher and Quantum Hardware expert Dr. R. Vijay
                Raghavan
                research on Quantum computing and work on Quantum hardware is going on in TIFR. (The only
                established
                experimental group in India which is working on superconducting quantum devices known as Quantum
                Measurement
                and Control (QuMaC) Lab in TIFR headed by him).
                This group started in Dec 2012, became fully operational in Jan 2014 and has already several
                important
                publications which include the development of a new type of ultra-low noise broadband amplifier for
                quantum
                measurements and a novel three-qubit quantum processor called the "trimon".</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Conclusion: -</h2>
            <p>Quantum computing promises many possibilities and a new vision to the world. Although no one
                completely
                understands the quantum algorithms and how a quantum computer to be programmed. Also a little knows
                how
                it
                works and processes the data, but still the researches on it makes us await a new vision to
                visualize
                and
                see the quantum world. The days are not far when quantum computing and quantum physics will change
                how
                the
                world behave and may it bring new hopes for us in knowing this quantum world in a better way.</p>
